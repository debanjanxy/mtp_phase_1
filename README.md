MTP phase-I is the first phase of my Master's project. The directory named "papers" contain the necessary papers that I have to
study and the directory named "code" contain all the code of my project. It also contain a folder named experiments. It contains
all the experimentation I've done for my MTP, like learning new things and trying out new technology or implementing a paper etc.
